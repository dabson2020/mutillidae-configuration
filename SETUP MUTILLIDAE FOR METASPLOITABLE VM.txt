HOW TO SET UP MUTILLIDAE IN METASPLOITABLE VM

Login to Metasploitable VM
change directory into /var/www/mutillidae/ by typing
	cd /var/www/mutillidae/
After the directory has changed, open the config.inc file by typing
	sudo nano config.inc
enter your password

The database file will be opened

change the dbname from 'metasploit' to 'owasp10'

save by pressing CTRL + X and Yes

You will be taken back to the command prompt

We need to ensure that we can configure the owasp database through the web browser and so 
we need  to edit open the php.ini file and edit the 'allow_url_include to 'ON'. To do this:

Leave the /var/www/mutillidae/ by typing cd

Change directory into this directory '/etc/php5/cgi

and open the file php.ini by typing

sudo nano php.ini

Press ctrl+W to search and open 'fopen'

scroll down to 'allow_url_include and change it from off to on.

Save the changes by pressing ctrl+X and Yes and then enter.

Next is to restart the apache server
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
Hit Enter
Once it successfullty restart, type ifconfig to see the ip address
Type the ip address in your web browser, select mutillidae and login with the default
username and password.
